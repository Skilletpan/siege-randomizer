# Welcome to Siege Randomizer!

Siege Randomizer is a small web-app with several tools to randomize your Siege-experience. It currently features a Map Picker, an Operator Picker and a Strat Roulette, all are still to be expanded on.

##  Technical Stuff

Siege Randomizer is built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com).
